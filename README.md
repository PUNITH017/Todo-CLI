Here's a sample `README.md` for your CLI assignment. It highlights the features, installation steps, and example usage:

# To-Do CLI

This is a command-line interface (CLI) application for managing a to-do list. The CLI allows users to add, delete, and mark tasks as done. All to-do items are stored in a local `todos.json` file.

## Features

- **Add a To-Do**: Easily add a task to your to-do list.
- **Delete a To-Do**: Remove a task by its unique ID.
- **Mark as Done**: Mark a task as completed.
- **List To-Dos**: View all your tasks and their status (pending or completed).
  
## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your machine.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo/todo-cli.git
    cd todo-cli
    ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies using npm:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. You're ready to use the CLI.

## Usage

1. **Add a To-Do**

    To add a new to-do, use the `add` command followed by your task description:
    ```bash
    node cli.js add "Buy groceries"
    ```
    Output:
    ```
    Added: "Buy groceries"
    ```

2. **Delete a To-Do**

    To delete a to-do by its ID:
    ```bash
    node cli.js delete <id>
    ```

    Example:
    ```bash
    node cli.js delete 1695763721456
    ```
    Output:
    ```
    Deleted todo with ID: 1695763721456
    ```

3. **Mark a To-Do as Done**

    To mark a to-do as done by its ID:
    ```bash
    node cli.js done <id>
    ```

    Example:
    ```bash
    node cli.js done 1695763721456
    ```
    Output:
    ```
    Marked todo with ID: 1695763721456 as done.
    ```

4. **List All To-Dos**

    To list all tasks and see their status (whether they are completed or not):
    ```bash
    node cli.js list
    ```
    Output:
    ```
    [ ] 1695763721456 - Buy groceries
    [x] 1695763721548 - Finish homework
    ```

## File Storage

All your tasks are saved in the `todos.json` file in the same directory as your script. This file is automatically created when you run the application for the first time.

## Credits

This project was created as part of my CLI assignment. It showcases the use of `Commander.js` for building interactive command-line tools and `fs` for file handling in Node.js.
